## Understanding Probability Computations in the Codebase

To effectively compute mutual information, it's crucial to understand how the probabilities \( P(O) \) (the probability of each outcome \( O \)) and \( P(O|C) \) (the probability of each outcome \( O \) given a codeword \( C \)) are handled in your codebase. Below, we break down the relevant parts of the code from `cost_function.py` and `tf_engine.py`.

### \( P(O|C) \) - Probability of Outcome Given Codeword

This probability is computed in the method `run_tf_circuit_probabilities` within the `TFEngine` class in `tf_engine.py`. This method calculates the probabilities of different outcomes given a specific input codeword. The method returns a list of probabilities for each outcome based on the input codeword.

```python
def run_tf_circuit_probabilities(self, circuit: Circuit, options: TFEngineRunOptions) -> List[EagerTensor]:
```

### \( P(O) \) - Probability of Each Outcome

To compute \( P(O) \), you need to average \( P(O|C) \) over all codewords \( C \). This isn't directly computed in any single method but can be derived by averaging the output of `run_tf_circuit_probabilities` across all codewords. This computation would typically be done in a higher-level method where you have access to the results from all codewords.

### Suggested Implementation for \( P(O) \)

You can implement the computation of \( P(O) \) in a method that calls `run_tf_circuit_probabilities` for each codeword and then averages the results. This could be part of a new method or an existing method that processes results from multiple codewords.

```python
def compute_overall_outcome_probabilities(self, circuit: Circuit, options: TFEngineRunOptions) -> List[float]:
all_probabilities = [self.run_tf_circuit_probabilities(circuit, options) for codeword in options.input_batch.codewords]
# Average probabilities across all codewords to get P(O)
p_o = np.mean(all_probabilities, axis=0)
return p_o
```

### Integration

Ensure that wherever you need to compute mutual information, you have access to both \( P(O|C) \) and \( P(O) \). Use these probabilities to compute the mutual information as described in your mutual information computation formula.

## Updates for Mutual Information Metric

### Implementation in `cost_function.py`

- **Mutual Information Computation**:
  The method `_compute_mutual_information` has been introduced to compute the mutual information using the quantum circuit and engine configurations. This method is pivotal for scenarios where understanding the amount of information gained about one random variable through another is crucial.

### Implementation in `tf_engine.py`

- **Mutual Information Method**:
  `_run_tf_mutual_information` method computes the mutual information for specified circuit settings. It calculates this based on the detailed probabilities of outcomes given specific codewords and the overall probabilities of outcomes, crucial for effective quantum state discrimination.

- **Measurement Type Handling**:
  The `run_tf_circuit_checking_measuring_type` method has been streamlined to focus on the type of measurement (PROBABILITIES or SAMPLING) without the need to check for metric types, simplifying the logic and ensuring that the method is focused and efficient.

### Conclusion

These updates ensure that the system can compute not only success probabilities but also mutual information, enhancing the analytical capabilities of the quantum state discrimination process. The integration of mutual information into the metric computation framework allows for a deeper understanding and optimization of quantum circuits based on information-theoretic principles.
